The game starts with 4 seed in each house. The objective of the game is to capture more seeds than your opponent and, since there are 48 seeds, capturing 25 is enough. The game can end with a draw, since there's a even number of seeds.


### Sowing

Players take turns moving the seeds. On each turn, the player chooses one of the six houses on their side of the table, removing all the seeds in that house and distributing them for the next houses, one seed per house, including the opponent's houses, in a counterclockwise way. You can't seed either in the score houses or in the house you picked to remove the seeds.


### Capturing

You can capture the seeds in a opponent's house when, the last sowed seed makes a house 2 or 3 seeds, and doesn't capture all of the opponent's seeds. In a turn you can capture seeds from more than one house. The captured seeds are stored in the scoring houses.
